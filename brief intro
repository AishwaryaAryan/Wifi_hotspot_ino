# ESP8266 WiFi Hotspot (Access Point Mode) ðŸ“¶

## Overview  
This project configures an *ESP8266 as a WiFi hotspot* (Access Point), allowing other devices to connect to it.

## Features  
âœ… Turns ESP8266 into a *WiFi Hotspot*  
âœ… Allows multiple devices to connect  
âœ… Prints *IP Address & connected device count*  

## Hardware Requirements  
- *ESP8266* (NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini, etc.)  
- *Arduino IDE* with ESP8266 board installed  

## Installation & Usage  
1. Open wifi_hotspot.ino in Arduino IDE.  
2. Set your preferred ssid and password.  
3. Upload the code to the ESP8266.  
4. Open the Serial Monitor at *9600 baud*.  
5. The ESP8266 will display:  
   - The *SSID* (network name)  
   - The *IP Address* for connected devices  
   - The number of connected devices  

## Code Explanation  
- The ESP8266 creates a *WiFi network* with the given SSID and password.  
- Devices can *connect* to the hotspot.  
- The ESP8266 prints the *number of connected devices* in the Serial Monitor.
